    <a href="http://erewhon.oucs.ox.ac.uk/">Erewhon Project</a>, a
    <a href="http://www.jisc.ac.uk/">JISC</a>-funded project to explore the
    provision of location-aware applications and adaption of Weblearn (Oxford's implementation of the Sakai VLE) for use on
    mobile devices. <br />
    
    It is designed and managed by Tim Fernando and Alexander Dutton at Oxford University Computing Services.
